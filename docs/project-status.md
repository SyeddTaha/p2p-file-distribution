## 2. Teammate Environment Setup

Teammates joining the project can initialize their environment with one command block:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository & enter directory
git clone <repo-url>
cd p2p-file-distribution

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1    # On Windows (PowerShell)
source .venv/bin/activate     # On Linux / macOS

# 3. Install dependencies and project in editable mode
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Verify environment setup
pytest
ruff check .
mypy src/p2p
```

## 6. Open Issues & Known Limitations

- Milestone 3 storage operations are synchronous; async callers must offload large file work and serialize access to a shared `StorageManager`.
- Partial-download resume and serving verified chunks to peers are deferred to later milestones.
- Full test runs emit one upstream Starlette/httpx deprecation warning; it does not fail tests.

## 7. Decisions Needed

- None for Milestone 3. The v1 empty-file and resume policies are recorded in [ADR 0003](adr/0003-manifest-v1-and-storage-policy.md).
